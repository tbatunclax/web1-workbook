## What is the difference between Web Hosts, Domains, and FTP?

**Web Hosts** are hosting services that provide server space for storing data and files on the internet. Eg, if you have a website, your files are most likely stored on a web hosting server.

**Domains** are the web address of a website. A URL is a complete address of a web page, which will contain the information of the Domain.

**FTP** is a file transfer protocol and it provides the means to upload or download files.
