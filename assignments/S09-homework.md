## What is the difference between jpg, gif, png and SVG images?

## jpg

JPG is a type of image compression, used mainly for photos, portraits and images where color variances are important such as digital photographs. Image quality may decrease if you reduce the file size. JPG images do not support transparency.

## gif

Gif or graphics interchange format, support transparency. Gif images have the ability to display a sequence of images, giving them the animated property called interlaced Gifs. GIFs are ideal for logos in websites, as they support transparency.

# png

PNG or Portable Network Graphics was created after GIF technology became copyrighted. Like GIF images they have the transparency property, in addtion to that, they support variable transparency, which let users control the degree of transparency. One drawback is that older browsers may not fully support PNG images.

## svg

SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics is based on XML. SVG code can be human read and can be manipulated by CSS or Javascript. SVG images have the abilty to scale in size without losing image detail. Due to this vector graphics property, SVGs are ideal to display high quality images on different screen sizes.
