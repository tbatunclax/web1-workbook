## What are Single Page Apps(SPAs)? How do they differ from traditional multi-page Web Sites??

Single Page Apps are developed on Javascript frameworks. The framework contains packages that can be built upon as building blocks for the site without starting from scratch. The design concept of SPAs are developed on single page application, whereas traditional websites are built on multiple pages. 

Web sites built on SPA technology loads much faster than traditional multi page sites as the content is loaded on a single page and does not need to load multple pages as it is required on traditional non SPA sites.
