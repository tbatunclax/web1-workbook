## What are testing environments? What is the difference between Local, Dev, QA and Production?

Testing environments allow the developers to do readily defined test cases while in different development stages.

## Local testing environment 

In a local testing environment, only the developer can view and access the test. This is the initial development and test phase, which may not be ready to be shared externally or to the development team.

## Dev testing environment

In a development testing environment, the development is done in a shared environment, source control like git is used for the collaborative work among the development team, for further development and testing.

## QA testing environment

In quality assurance testing environment, the configurations and settings are setup to simulate the production environment. This testing environment would allow the QA team to do a thorough check on the functionalities and integrity of the product prior to deployment.

## Production environment

This is the environment where the final product, which has passed the qa testing environment, is deployed for business use.
