Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)

HTML or the Hyper Text Markup landguage is the primary markup language of a web page. It is the foundational structure of the of a web page which is also known as the document object model (DOM). An HTML document contains information of the structure or the layout of the web page and as well as the content itself.   

The HTML document follows a tree like sturucture. Like a family tree there are tags or elements referred as parents, descendants, children and siblings depending on the location in the document. There are tags such as <HEAD>, <body> and <div> that defines the section of the document. There are also tags that define the content type, tags such as <h1> heading, <p> paragraph, <li> lists. In addtion to the types of information, an HTML document contains information related to the content of the page, such as <a> hyper inks , <img> images <link> location to resource files such as css and javascript files.

These tags can be described as the underlying nuts and bolts that provides information on the structure and content of the web page.


Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

Cascading style sheets or css controls the styling and formatting of a web page. While the HTML mostly deals with the structure and content, CSS is used to define how the content of the page is to be displayed. It provides the web developer the necessary control of the format and design of a web page. This is done by manipulating the elements and attributes, or referred to as CSS selectors of the HTML tags. By manipulating the tags in the CSS, you can define the size of the images and fonts, the color of the fonts and backgrounds and the overall appearence of the web page. The cascading property allows the web developer to implement an overall theme as well as custom format settings so that it only affects certain specified section of a web page.

Javascript

Javascript is a scripting language and in the context of web development, it is use to control the interactivity part of a web page. Javascript is used to control the interaction between the browser and the visitor/user of the page. The javascript may used to run basic functions such as create pop-ups when clicking buttons or scrolling to the top of the page, animate images, to creating a more advanced features such as manipulating DOMs to dynamically update contents in a web page.

In summary, HTML handles the structural and content, CSS the visual, and Javascript the behavioral components of a web page.
